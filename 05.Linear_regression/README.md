# Linear Regression:
A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X.

The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables. Continuous predictor variables are also called covariates, and categorical predictor variables are also called factors.
